            </span> to the <strong>Minister of Education</strong> (17 Jul 2009): Further to her answer to QWA 6991 (2009), what are the changes in assumptions which led to each of the changes in the forecasts ?

              Hon
              Anne
              Tolley
            </span> (Minister of Education) replied: Forecasting changes in the 2009 March Baseline Update comprised the following (all figures $000, GST exclusive):
School Operations       2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Changes in Rolls        (5,224) 2,374   1,109   979     1,579  
Changes in Rates        (104)   3,825   2,896   2,894   2,889  
Correspondence School   2,714   2,714   2,714   2,714   2,714  
TOTAL   (2,614) 8,913   6,719   6,587   7,182  
The increases in forecast school operations funding (Primary Education, Secondary Education and Special Needs Support) across the forecast period were mainly due to:
•	Changes in Roll Distribution – secondary rolls were projected to decrease for the outyears at a lower rate than previously forecast due to a predicted rise in retention. Primary rolls were projected to increase at the same rate but to a lower extent than anticipated in the previous forecast due to the National School Roll Projections which predicted lower rolls due to falling migration.  
•	Changes in Rates – maintenance was increased due to the previous year’s 3.1% inflation adjustment which had not been applied to maintenance in the previous forecast, as well as a number of back-payments owing to schools, and payments for swimming pools. 
•	Correspondence School – increased costs of secondary education programmes for the correspondence school owing to higher than expected numbers of students.  

Teacher Salaries        2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Full-time Teacher Equivalents   (9,560) (27,502)        (29,029)        (18,243)        (4,965)
Rates   5,500   13,670  13,980  14,004  14,056 
Holiday Pay: FTTEs      (1,736) (1,352) 918     3,091   2,513  
Operating Impact        (5,796) (15,184)        (14,131)        (1,148) 11,604 
Forecast changes for teacher salaries funding (Primary Education, Secondary Education and Special Needs Support) were due to:
•	Full-time Teacher Equivalents (FTTEs) – latest national school roll projections were incorporated. 
•	Rates – the change was a result of better data based on actual fortnightly rates in the second tranche of the 2007 to 2010 Collective Agreements. 
•	Holiday Pay: FTTEs – the changes to teacher numbers above also had a flow on effect for the cost of teacher holiday pay at the end of the financial year.  

School Transport        2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Daily and Technology Services   3,265   4,933   5,062   5,313   5,728  
Direct Resourced Services       1,747   4,944   4,884   4,740   4,680  
Special Needs – Taxi    2,126   1,961   2,536   3,122   3,615  
Other   37      (61)    (65)    (65)    (61)   
Operating Impact        7,175   11,777  12,417  13,110  13,962 
The increases in the transport forecast across the forecast period were owing to a combination of:  
•	Daily and Technology Services – the change in 2008/09 was the result of a combination of increased contractual rates in the new tender round, higher than forecast global rating adjustments based on the September 2008 quarter, which had not yet reflected the impact of later falls in fuel prices, partly offset by reduction in the number of daily routes.  Contract rates in subsequent years reflected CPI changes.  
•	Special Needs Taxi – the 2008 contract provided for taxi operators to receive updated contractual rates over time when a certain threshold was met (e.g. student numbers or route distances increased by 2%).  
•	Directly Resourced Services (DRS) – adjustments reflecting more daily routes than expected moving to DRS. 
•	Other - forecasts for Special Needs Conveyance, Conveyance Allowance and kura kaupapa Māori being refined slightly since the 2008 October Baseline Update and correcting information . 

Early Childhood Education       2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Volume of Hours 30,454  36,191  34,230  36,201  41,290 
Hours Composition       14,685  17,974  18,433  (3,757) (8,836)
20 Hours ECE Take-Up Rates      (615)   (947)   (1,032) (1,178) (1,314)
Small Components        (1,880) (117)   (120)   (129)   (131)  
Operating Impact        42,644  53,101  51,511  31,137  31,009 
A significant increase was expected in the early childhood education (ECE) forecast. The key factors in this forecast were:
•	Volumes of Hours – a combination of growth in participation and population growth. Adjustments were made to 2008/09 to take into account year-to-date figures for Over 2s which were above the 2008 October Baseline Update forecast. From 2009/10 onwards it was expected the Over 2s would grow in line with population growth. In Under 2s there was an adjustment to forecast for population growth. 
•	Hours Composition – a reduction in the number of sessional kindergartens, from the current total of 424 to approximately 260 by 2012/13. All-day services were also predicted to move up the funding bands faster than expected in the 2008 October Baseline Update forecast. 
•	20 Hours ECE Take-up Rates – an increase in the proportion of hours attributable to the 20 Hours ECE scheme for children aged two and over attending quality Te Kōhanga Reo services from 20 to 25 per cent.  The 100% all-day proportion was lowered from 74 to 72 per cent. 
•	Small Components – the year to date under-expenditure in equity funding of $1.6 million was expected to continue in 2008/09 with fewer services receiving equity funding. The rolls at the Correspondence School were expected to keep falling, reducing the forecast by approximately $0.2 million each year. Other minor changes were also forecast. 

Other Forecast Changes  2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13
Special Education Third Party Revenue   (1,100) (1,300) (1,300) (1,300) (1,300)
Integrated School Property      (400)   -       -       -       -      
Interest Subsidies on School Loans      (123)   (196)   (288)   (355)   (394)  
Reduced Loans for WITT  (400)   -       -       -       -      
Reduced WITT Financial Assistance       (400)   -       -       -       -      
Total   (2,423) (1,496) (1,588) (1,655) (1,694)
Other forecast changes included: 
•	reductions in third party contract revenue for Group Special Education, as more focus was put on provision of core services.  
•	a minor change to policy 1 funding in the current year for Integrated School Property.  
•	a combination of some loans for integrated schools coming to an end over the forecast period and revised interest rate forecasts for Interest Subsidies on School Loans.  
•	the balance of $0.4 million on loans available for the Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki will not be required. 
•	as a consequence the value of loans that will be converted to a non-interest bearing suspensory loan and ultimately to equity will be $0.4 million less than estimated for Cabinet.
