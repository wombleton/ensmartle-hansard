              Cosgrove
            </span> to the <strong>Minister of Corrections</strong> (29 Jun 2009): How many prison inmates were actively involved in building prisons as at 25 June 2009, and at which prisons?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          
            <span class="personname Minister">
              Hon
              Judith
              Collins
            </span> (Minister of Corrections) replied: There are currently 19 prisoners involved in prison building or modification work.
This includes four prisoners involved in installation work at Rimutaka Prison, ten prisoners employed in joinery manufacture at Hawkes Bay Prison and 5 prisoners involved in a project modifying cell frontages at Auckland Prison.

During the construction of the 4 new facilities; Northland Region Corrections Facility, Auckland Region Women’s Corrections Facility, Otago Corrections Facility and Spring Hill Corrections Facility, numerous prisoners contributed to the building through the production of concrete panels, manufacture of trolleys, trailers, cell furniture, prison bedding and cell doors, windows and grilles.  Prisoners were also involved in the manufacture of fence components and fence erection, landscaping, and the production of personal protective clothing (vests) for use on the building sites.

The current number of prisoners involved in prison construction is likely to increase as CIE contributes to the supply of engineering products and bedding components for the Mount Eden Prison construction project.
Additionally CIE is exploring the feasibility for prisoners to be involved in the conversion of shipping containers into cell accommodation.
It is not the aim of CIE to produce fully qualified plumbers, electricians, carpenters or drain-layers. Rather, the focus is on providing opportunities for prisoners to gain pre-trade qualifications and pathways toward National Certificates through the National Qualifications Framework.  CIE aims for National Certificate Level 2 as opposed to fully qualified trade qualifications, as CIE does not have a mandate to train apprentices.  
Carpentry training is provided at Auckland, Christchurch, Hawkes Bay, Invercargill, Manawatu, Mt Eden, Rimutaka and Wanganui Prisons and at Northland Region and Otago Corrections Facilities.  During 2008/2009, 279 prisoners at those sites received training in carpentry compared to 229 in the 2007/2008 year. The levels of  qualifications achieved by those prisoners undertaking carpentry training at those sites is included in table 1 below.  
In addition to the above, carpentry training is also delivered at the Building Refurbishment Yard at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.  The Building Refurbishment Yard which opened in June 2008 provides prisoners with entry level training intended to fulfil the prerequisites for employment within a number of trades.  The training enables prisoners to gain hands on experience of building, roofing, installing insulation, plastering, painting, cabinet making, plumbing and electrical trades.  
The Spring Hill Corrections Facility Building Refurbishment Yard is the only site offering training in plumbing and electrical trades.
On 25 June 2009, 55 prisoners were employed in building refurbishment work at Spring Hill Corrections Facility.  A total of 109 prisoners have received training at the refurbishment yard in 2008/09 .  The level of qualifications achieved is detailed in table 1.
In addition to the broad range of training and employment opportunities offered by CIE, externally provided EFTS funded training in building construction and allied trades courses, painting, small motors, horticulture and forestry also takes place at a number of prisons.  Weltec provides National Certificate training in painting - level 3,  Weltech Certificate in Motor Industry - level 2 and Weltech Certificate in Building, Construction and Allied Trades - level 2 at Rimutaka Prison.  Northtec provides training in Northtech Certificate in Forestry - level 2, National Certificate in Horticulture,  and Northtech Certificate in Building, Construction and Allied Trades - level 2 at Northland Region Corrections Facility.  UCOL provides National Certificate in Building, Construction and Allied Trades - level 2 at Manawatu Prison, and UCOL Certificate in Motor Industry at Wanganui Prison.
Table 2 below provides the number of prisoners who undertook employment and training, and completed training by being assessed as achieving at least one unit standard on the National Qualifications Framework during the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 years.
Table 3 attached provides the number of prisoners who completed training by activity and level of qualification during 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 years.
Table 4 provides the numbers of prisoners involved in Corrections Inmate Employment (excluding Release to Work) as at 25 June 2008 and 2009.  Those prisoners would have been working on a variety of National Qualification Framework qualification levels on those dates.  The numbers undertaking plumbing and electrical training as at 25 June 2008 and 2009 are included in figures provided in the table for building refurbishment, joinery and externally provided EFTs funded training.  Plumbing and electrical training are not recorded as separate activities.
While CIE provides a broad range of training and employment activities as listed in the table, it does not deliver training in drain-laying.
