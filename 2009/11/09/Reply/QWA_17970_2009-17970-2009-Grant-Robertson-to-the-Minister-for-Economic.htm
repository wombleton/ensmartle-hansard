              Hon
              Gerry
              Brownlee
            </span> (Minister for Economic Development) replied: The government expects all departmental chief executives to work continuously to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and alignment with the government’s priorities of the spending that they administer, including looking for more innovative and cost effective ways of delivering services to the public.  The government has directed departmental chief executives to identify what actions they will need to take to meet the government’s expectation outlined above and compile these as “performance improvement actions” (PIAs) for discussion and agreement with their Ministers.   PIAs may result in fiscal savings, but they may more appropriately be a matter of ensuring that services can be delivered sustainably, more effectively and more in tune with the needs of citizens.  The expectation is that chief executives should focus initially on the kinds of changes they will need to make over the next 5 years given their department’s circumstances, rather than identifying specific amount of savings for each action.
The Ministry of Economic Development has identified in its 2009/10 Output Plan steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the expenditure for the six Votes it administers and where applicable, cost savings resulting from these actions.  These are identified in the following tables.  

The focus of the performance improvement actions is about determining what kind of change the Ministry is going to need to make over the medium term and starting to identify the kinds of actions that will be required to get there.  Therefore, only those actions resulting from the value for money exercise have currently been identified as cost savings for this current financial year.  
This response also covers questions 17994 (2009) and 17967 (2009).
