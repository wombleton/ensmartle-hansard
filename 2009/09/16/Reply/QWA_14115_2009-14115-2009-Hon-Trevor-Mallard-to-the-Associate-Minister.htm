2. The Advisory Panel on the Review of Special Education.  
Date established: 19 August 2009 
 
Membership
The members of the Advisory Panel have been selected because they bring particular expertise on special education.  Members do not sit on the Panel as representatives of any organisation; they are invited as individuals and contribute in that capacity.  
 
The members of the Advisory Panel are:
• Jill Bevan-Brown, Associate Professor, Special Education, Massey University
• Roderick Deane,  Economist, Public Sector Reformer and Businessman
• Paul Gibson, Senior Disability Advisor, Capital and Coast District Health Board,  
• Brian Hinchco, Principal, Papatoetoe South Intermediate School, South Auckland
• Heather Lear, Parent and Lawyer
 
The Associate Minister may invite other individuals to contribute on an ad hoc basis as issues arise.
 
Terms of Reference
 
Background
The Government is undertaking a Review of Special Education.  The Review is to examine and make recommendations on a range of issues in special education including access to services, access to schooling, outcomes for students, accountability arrangements, workforce, transitions, and fragmentation of service delivery.   
 
There is approximately $450 million invested in special education annually.  Government needs to be assured that it is getting best value for this money.  The current model of funding to support children and young people with special education needs was developed in the mid-1990s and there has been considerable change in operating environments since that time.  Consultation over the last ten years has shown that special education provision is fragmented and not well coordinated.  There are also concerns from parents, principals and sector organisations that there is room for improvement on a number of fronts such as improved access and more effective supports. The Terms of Reference for the Review are appended.  
 
The Associate Minister of Education, Hon Heather Roy is responsible for the Review and is to establish an Advisory Panel to assist her.  
 
Role and scope
The Advisory Panel on the Review of Special Education is to provide advice, perspectives and act as a ‘sounding-board’ for the Associate Minister of Education on the range of issues in the Review of Special Education.  The Advisory Panel is not a decision-making body.
Members will:
• provide free and frank advice to the Associate Minister about the issues covered by the Review.
• share insights, expertise and experience 
• provide advice on the alignment between issues in the Review and other programmes and initiatives
• provide comment about the Review if requested by the Associate Minister.
 
At the request of the Associate Minister, the Advisory Panel or the Ministry of Education, the Advisory Panel may engage directly with the Ministry of Education on specific matters.  Such request will be channelled through the Associate Minister.
 
The Advisory Panel is established for the duration of the Review.  That is, from the announcement of the Review until it concludes in July 2010.
  
Process and operating procedures
In general, the Advisory Panel will provide its advice through meetings with the Associate Minister.  Between meetings the Associate Minister may seek collective or individual contributions via teleconference etc.
 
Meetings and discussions may be attended by the Ministry of Education.
 
Members will be required to have a good understanding of the current context for special education.  Relevant research and reports will be provided.  
 
Etiquette
Meetings will be conducted in a manner that promotes open and frank discussion.  Discussion is confidential to those present Panel members will not disclose any information obtained as a member of the Panel.  Any requests under the Official Information Act 1982 will be responded to by the Associate Minister and the Ministry through usual procedures. 
 
Meeting Procedure
Meetings will be for no more than two half days a month and be arranged in advance and cognisant of members’ other priorities, of resources and in time for members to organise travel and other logistics.  Documentation required for meetings should be provided to members at least five days ahead of time.  
 
Travel and expenses
Members’ willingness to volunteer their time to be on the Panel is appreciated.  Travel will be reimbursed by the Ministry on an actual and reasonable basis.
